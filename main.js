// Manually add every student BUT yourself to the above array by directly writing the strings in there, and console out how many are in there, using `length`.

// Now use `push` to get yourself in there, and console out the new length.

// Now console out the 1st person. It should be 'Colin'!



console.log('# Challenge #4');

// Console out the 5th person. Don't forget to start counting at 0!

// Remove the last person and console out the new length of the array. It should be the same as Challenge #1, since we've added then removed one person.



console.log('# Challenge #8');

// Now console out the person you just removed. You might have to change the code from a previous challenge to save that person before they're gone!



console.log('# Challenge #9');

// Now remove and console out the name of the _first_ person on the list.

// Now remove and console out the name of the _new_ first person on the list.

// Now add 'Ginny' to the _start_ of the list and console out the new length of the array.


console.log('# Challenge #11');

// Now add 'Yury' to the start of the list and console out the _new_ new length of the array.



console.log('# Challenge #12');

// Now console out the whole list. You should only need one `console.log`, although you may have to click the arrow to see the whole list.

// It should be the entire list of students minus yourself, with 'Colin' and 'Mesuara' replaced with 'Yury' and 'Ginny'. In ot
